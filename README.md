This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).

## Environment variables

Copy `.env.example` to `.env.local` and fill in real values. `.env.local` is gitignored.

| Variable | Scope | Required | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `GEMINI_API_KEY` | **server only** | yes | Used by `/api/*` routes for trip generation. Never exposed to the browser. Get one at [aistudio.google.com/apikey](https://aistudio.google.com/apikey). |
| `NEXT_PUBLIC_GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY` | **public** | yes | Browser-side Maps JS key. Restrict it to your deployed origin in the GCP console. |

> **Security note:** any variable prefixed with `NEXT_PUBLIC_` is bundled into the client JS. Do **not** put server secrets behind that prefix.

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/building-your-application/optimizing/fonts) to automatically optimize and load [Geist](https://vercel.com/font), a new font family for Vercel.
